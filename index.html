    <p> This character was created by Michael, when they knocked Asha over the head with a piece of paper. Usually this would turn Asha
         into <a href="https://asha411.github.io/jeremy/">Jeremy</a>, but for unknown reasons, since as soon as Asha woke up, Michael said "mama!" a new character was created.
        <hr>
        At first, she only knew how to say "mama!" But then Michael taught her to say "fuck!" She then picked up a bit more English but
        to this day mainly only speaks in "mamas" and "fucks"
